Play against the computer in a rock paper scissors game!

How to play: 
The game starts when the rock, paper, or scissors button is clicked. 
When a player reaches a score of 5, the game ends. 
The first player to reach 5 points is the winner.

What I learned:
- Transitions
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Listeners
- onClick Functions
